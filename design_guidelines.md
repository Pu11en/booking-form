I cannot generate comprehensive design guidelines at this time because the conversation is incomplete. The user has changed direction mid-conversation but hasn't provided the necessary information to proceed.

## Missing Critical Information:

1. **Target URL**: The user mentioned "imma just have the buttons go to this link" but didn't provide the actual link
2. **Design Scope**: It's unclear if we're still designing a booking form page or if the buttons will redirect to an external service
3. **Page Structure**: We don't know what pages or components need to be designed

## To Proceed, I Need:

**From the User:**
- The complete URL where the buttons should link to
- Confirmation of whether we're building a booking form page or using an external form service
- What pages/components need design guidelines (homepage with CTA buttons only? a booking page? both?)

**OR**

**From the Manager:**
- Clarification from the user about their final requirements
- A complete project scope to design for

Once I have this information, I can provide comprehensive design guidelines covering:
- Visual approach (Reference-based or Design System)
- Color palette, typography, and spacing system
- Component library and interaction patterns
- Responsive layout guidelines
- Specific guidance for the booking flow UX

Please obtain the missing information so I can deliver proper design guidelines.
